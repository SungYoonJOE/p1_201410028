Python is a widely used high-level, general-purpose, interpreted, dynamic programming language.
[23][24] Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability,
and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than would be possible in languages such as C++ or Java.
[25][26] The language provides constructs intended to enable clear programs on both a small and large scale.[27]
